**Time-related Factor:**
- Investigate if there were any time-related factors within the specified month, such as holidays, special events, or seasonal trends that might have influenced user behavior and, subsequently, revenue.

**Region-related Factor:**
- Examine revenue data across different regions served by Uber during the specific month. Identify any regional variations or specific market conditions that could have contributed to the decline.

**Other-related Factor:**
- Explore other internal factors, such as changes in pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, or alterations to the Uber app interface. Assess whether any of these factors coincided with the revenue drop.

**Platform-related Factor:**
- Analyze the performance of the Uber app on different platforms (iOS, Android) to rule out any technical issues or discrepancies that might have affected user engagement and revenue.

**Cannibalization:**
- Investigate if the introduction of new services or features within the Uber platform might have led to cannibalization, diverting users away from the traditional revenue-generating services.
